# hangman-with-python
This is a HANGMAN game made with Python but the person making it is a python novice (1 week)
(I'm stupid)

How to play(Linux)(I don't know about Windows):

1. Open terminal
2. Install the `git` package if you haven't already
3. `clone` or **download the .py file here**
(for how to use the clone command, write `git clone https://github.com/DamDucHuy/hangman-with-python.git`)
4. Run this .py file through the command `python3 name.py`
(change the name to the appropriate file name)
Thanks for playing!:D

h6ngmaN2p is a 2 player version, one gives the word and the other guesses!
